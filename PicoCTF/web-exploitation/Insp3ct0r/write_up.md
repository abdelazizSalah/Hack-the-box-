- All we need to do is to open the website, then use the inspector using f12, and try to find the flag as comments in the html code.
- then we should also go to the .css file and the .js to see other parts of the flag
- picoCTF{tru3_d3  => the .html page
- t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t -> .css page
- the last one must be in the .js ;)
- _lucky?f10be399} => as expected

= final flag is: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}
